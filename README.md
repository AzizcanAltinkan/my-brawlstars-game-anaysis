# my-brawlstars-game-anaysis
This project involves analyzing my personal Brawl Stars dataset, which I scraped and collected independently. This analysis aims to uncover patterns and insights about gameplay, player performance, and game dynamics.

My Dataset
For this project, I am using my own Brawl Stars data that I scraped directly from the game. The dataset contains detailed information about matches, players, and performance metrics. It includes the following attributes:

Match ID: A unique identifier for each match.

Timestamp: The date and time when the match took place.

Game Mode: The mode of the match (e.g., Gem Grab, Showdown, Brawl Ball).

Map Name: The map where the match occurred.

Player Name: The names of players in the match.

Brawler: The brawler selected by each player.

Trophies: The number of trophies each player had before the match.

Result: The outcome of the match (e.g., Win, Lose, Draw).

Damage Dealt: The total damage dealt by each player.

Stars Collected: The number of stars collected in specific game modes.

Rank: The player's rank in Showdown mode.

Power Level: The power level of the selected brawler.

Team Composition: Information about the teammates and their selected brawlers.

This dataset provides rich insights into gameplay dynamics, player strategies, and overall performance.




Project's Aim and Scope:

The goal of this project is to explore and analyze my gameplay data to identify patterns, trends, and areas for improvement. Specifically, the project seeks to answer questions such as:

Which game mode is my favorite, based on the number of matches played or time spent?

What are my most frequently used brawlers and how do they perform in different game modes?

Is there a specific map where I perform better or worse?

What is my win/loss ratio across different game modes?

Are there any patterns in my gameplay over time, such as better performance on weekends or during specific seasons?

Which teammates or team compositions lead to the best outcomes?

How do power levels affect my performance in matches?

Are there specific brawlers or game modes where I achieve consistently higher damage or rank?



Plan

The analysis will proceed in the following steps:

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:

Normalize the data format to ensure consistency across attributes.
Handle missing or incomplete data.
Create new attributes where necessary, such as "Match Duration" or "Performance Score".

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Use Python libraries like pandas and matplotlib to visualize trends and distributions in the dataset.
Analyze gameplay performance by game mode, map, and brawler.


Statistical Analysis:
Investigate correlations between variables such as brawler power level and match outcomes.
Examine trends over time, such as seasonal changes in performance.


Advanced Insights:
Use clustering to group similar matches or players based on performance.
Perform sentiment analysis on player strategies (if textual data is available).


Visualization and Reporting:
Present findings in charts and graphs for clarity.
Summarize key insights into a report or presentation.
Future Scope


This project could be extended to include:
Predictive modeling to recommend optimal brawler and team compositions for specific game modes or maps.
Developing a dashboard to track gameplay statistics and trends in real time.
Incorporating community data for comparative analysis.
By analyzing this dataset, I aim to improve my gameplay strategies and better understand the intricacies of Brawl Stars.
